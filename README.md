### Snake Game Project 🐍🎮

**Overview:**
This Snake Game project is a classic arcade game developed using Assembly language. It offers a fun and engaging way to understand low-level programming concepts while enjoying a nostalgic gaming experience. 🕹️✨

**Key Features:**
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive text-based UI. 🖥️
- **Game Mechanics**: Classic snake gameplay with score tracking. 🐍🔢
- **Controls**: Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction. ⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️
- **Game Over**: Displayed when the snake hits the boundary or itself. 💀
- **Title Screen**: Initial screen with game title and instructions. 🎬
- **High Scores**: Tracks and displays the highest scores achieved. 🏆

**Core Concepts:**
- **Assembly Language Programming**: Direct hardware manipulation, efficient code execution. 🖥️
- **Memory Management**: Usage of stack and heap for game data storage. 🗄️
- **Interrupts**: Use of software interrupts for various tasks (e.g., keyboard input, screen manipulation). ⌨️📺
- **Game Loop**: Continuous loop to keep the game running until a game over condition is met. 🔄
- **Buffering**: Use of a buffer to manage screen updates efficiently. 🖼️

**Assembly Instructions:**
1. **Clear Screen**: `clear_screen` function to reset the display. 🧹
2. **Show Title**: `show_title` function to display the game title. 🎩
3. **Start Playing**: `start_playing` function initiates the game loop. ▶️
4. **Game Over**: `show_game_over` function displays the game over screen. 🛑

**Function Details:**
- **Sleep**: Implements a delay for smooth gameplay. 💤
- **Clear Screen**: Resets the display buffer. 🖥️
- **Snake Movement**: Functions to handle snake crawling, direction changes, and collision detection. 🐍🔄
- **Buffer Operations**: Functions to write and read from the screen buffer, ensuring efficient screen updates. 💾

**Libraries Used:**
- **BIOS Interrupts**: For handling low-level hardware operations. 🔌
- **Direct Memory Access**: For manipulating the screen and input buffers directly. 💻

**Project Setup:**
1. Clone the repository. 📂
2. Assemble the code using an appropriate assembler. 🔧
3. Run the executable in a DOS environment or an emulator. 💽

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Low-level programming with Assembly language. 🖥️🔧
- Efficient use of memory and hardware resources. 🧠💾
- Implementation of classic game mechanics in a constrained environment. 🕹️
